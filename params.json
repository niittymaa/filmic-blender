  "body": "Who?\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis is a simple OpenColorIO configuration for intermediate to advanced imagers using Blender's Cycles raytracing engine.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis OpenColorIO configuration adds a closer-to-photorealistic view transform for your renders. For imagers working with non-photorealistic rendering, it also will bring significant dynamic range and lighting capabilities to your work, as well as potentially open up correct transforms for rendering to HDR displays and other such forward looking technology. It is as close to a Magic Button you can get for an experienced imager.\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis repository is ready to use right now, with no compilation or special Blender application binaries required.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n====\r\n\r\nBecause the basic sRGB EOTF was never designed for rendering and should be avoided. This configuration is as close as one will get to a magic button to help an imager elevate their rendering immediately.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n====\r\n\r\n1. Download this repository. Replace your current OpenColorIO configuration in Blender with this version.\r\n 1. The Blender OpenColorIO configuration directory is located in:\r\n\r\n        BLENDER/bin/VERSIONNUMBER/datafiles/colormanagement\r\n\r\n    Move the existing ````colormanagement```` directory to a backup location, and place the contents of\r\n    this repository into a new ````colormanagement```` directory.\r\n    \r\n 1. Optionally, instead of replacing the actual directory, use the envrionment variable to specify where the OCIO configuration lives:\r\n\r\n        export OCIO=/path/to/where/the/filmic-blender/config.ocio\r\n1. From within the Color Management panel, change the View to your desired contrast level and render.\r\n\r\nOnce you have Blender utilising the configuration, you are free to render away. You may discover that some of your materials were broken due to exceptionally low lighting levels, and may require reworking. General PBR advice holds true when using wider and more photographic illumination levels.\r\n",
